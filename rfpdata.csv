IBM Cloud Key Protect is used to produce, control, and distribute symmetric AES-256 keys and is backed by a FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or higher Hardware Security Module.
IBM Cloud internally uses encryption of data at rest at both the disk level (storage units, workstations, mobile devices) as well as at the volume level. 

IBM Cloud provide BYOK/KYOK functionality for customers to manage their own encryption keys.  This provides the Customer with the  capability to have unique encryption keys and KeyProtect provides management of those keys.
